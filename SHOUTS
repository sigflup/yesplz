Shouts to cobra2 for the support and letting me ssh into his box and get this 
working. Shouts to klaatu for all the testing, monsterb, lost'n'bronx, skirlet
for the wicked ascii bunny, deepgeek, enigma and the rest of the hpr crew! 
Shouts to kalisto- you know! Utopia, shouts to tit radio and the linuxcranks. 
Most of all shouts to this delicious clam-chowder I'm eating right now--- HMM!
